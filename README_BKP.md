    <code lang="html">phpup</code><br>The PHP Toolchain
</h1>

_Phpup_ is a single-file binary with _**zero dependencies**_ that includes Composer and other PHP tools. It also allows installing a per-project PHP based on your `composer.json`.

You don't need to have PHP or anything at all on your system to run it.

> [!WARNING]
> **Under heavy development**  
> Currently, this is an MVP, and only macOS aarch64 is supported.

## Installation

Download `phpup` binary from the release page and put it into a directory on your PATH, so you can simply call `phpup` from any directory.

```bash
curl -OL https://github.com/pronskiy/phpup/releases/latest/download/phpup
chmod +x phpup
sudo mv phpup /usr/local/bin/phpup
```

## Usage

- `phpup list` – See the list of available commands.
- `phpup <file>` – Run any php file. 🚧
- `phpup composer` – Composer that does not require PHP to be installed.
- `phpup conductor <command>` – Like npx but for PHP. 🚧
- `phpup locus` – Installs PHP binary under your project's `vendor/bin/php` based on the requirements in _composer.json_.

- ~~`phpup phpstan` – PHPStan that does not require PHP. 🚧~~
- ~~`phpup rector` – Rector that does not require PHP. 🚧~~
